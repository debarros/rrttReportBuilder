# COMPARISONclass.R

# An instance of this class holds the summary comparison information for a prior administration of a single test
# Each instance should be held within an instance of the REPORT class.
# Some parts of it are just based on the prior test.
# Other parts are actual comparisons, based on both the prior test and all of the results
